# Computational Simulation of Quine-McCluskey Algorithm using C/C++

* This project is made in undergraduate course "Digital Logic Circuits" (EEE2040.01-00) at Yonsei University. (2022-2)

## Abstract

Karnaugh Map method is often used to simplify Boolean functions. It is an intuitive and effective method. 
However, when the number of variables become larger, additional method is required due to its complexity. 
Quine-McCluskey algorithm provides more systematic approach than Karnaugh Map method. Therefore, it enables the usage of computer. 
The goal of this project is to create a computational simulation of Quine-McCluskey algorithm using C/C++.
